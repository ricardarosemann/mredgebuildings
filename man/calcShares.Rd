\description{
Merges and transforms the calculated shares from the Datasets:
Odyssee
IEA_ETP
TCEP
WEO
}
\details{
Enduse shares are extrapolated using a linear regression where the ETP datapoint
as well as selected regions from TCEP serves as origin and the entire TCEP dataset
provides the growth factor.

Carrier shares are exported w.r.t. to all carriers per region per period. In the case of
"carrierCorrection = TRUE", carrier shares are exported w.r.t. their contribution
to each individual enduse. The reason for the latter is that the implemantation
here is closer to EDGE-B, but didn't work well with further data processing
steps (e.g. toolDisaggregate) where EC shares are not necessarily used.
Hence, this case is by default disabled.

In the thermal case, the enduse "appliances" is transformed to "refrigerators"
using the region-specific refrigerator share used in EDGE-B. Higher resolved
data was not available.
}
\note{
The parameter "feOnly" is only applicable to IEA_ETP and TCEP data,
since this is the necessary data to do a full disaggregation of EU and EC
data, whereas Odyssee already gives disaggregated data for countries of the
European Union.

As done in EDGE-B, enduse-disaggregated FE data from WEO for the regions
MIE, AFR and JAP were used instead for values from IEA ETP.
