\description{
Calculate Efficiencies of Final (FE) to Useful (UE) Energy Conversion for all
combinations of Energy Carriers and Enduses. Missing data points within the
time interval of the original data (PFUDB) are filled with estimates from a
non-linear regression.
The efficiency projections are based on a model by De Stercke et al. which is
mainly driven by GDP per Capita. It describes an S-shaped curve approaching
assumed efficiency levels. The parameters of that curve are derived by a
regression with observations of IEA data.
